## __Technical Indicators:__

### 200-Day Moving Average:
>The 200-day moving average (200 DMA) is considered a key indicator by traders and market analysts for determining the overall long-term market trend. The price level in a market that coincides with the 200-DMA is recognized as a major support level when price is above the 200-DMA or resistance level when price is below the 200-DMA level.

### 100-Day Moving Average:
>The 100-day moving average (100 DMA) is considered a key indicator by traders and market analysts for determining the overall mid-term market trend. The price level in a market that coincides with the 100-DMA is recognized as a major support level when price is above the 100-DMA or resistance level when price is below the 100-DMA level.

### 50-Day Moving Average:
>The 50-day moving average (50 DMA) is considered a key indicator by traders and market analysts for determining the overall short-term market trend. The price level in a market that coincides with the 50-DMA is recognized as a major support level when price is above the 50-DMA or resistance level when price is below the 50-DMA level.

### Relative Strength Index:
>The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100. 

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence:
>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the "signal line," is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. 

### Volume Weighted Average Price:
>The volume weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of a security.
